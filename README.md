Our project has been deployed on the server [UW_Foodie](http://liuxin21.com).

## Background
Studying and working at the University of Waterloo consumes a great deal of energy. It’s necessary and sometimes urgent for students and faculty to find the nearest tasty food that’s available in a convenient way. A web app that collects the local food store info and provides the search function can make eating at a campus more enjoyable.
A potential customer said, No food, little hope. During the last term, after studying in my office for a whole day, I could hardly find a place on campus to feed myself. Those stores were closed or did not provide the food that I wanted. Since most of the food stores on campus are currently not accessible on google map, a web app that collects and shares the info of the local food store would be helpful.
